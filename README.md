## Swift Chat

Swift Chat is a real-time messaging platform developed using the Laravel framework. This project leverages Laravelâ€™s capabilities along with WebSocket technology for seamless communication. It uses the Laravel Reverb library for handling WebSocket connections on the server side and Laravel Echo for client-side interactions, enabling a smooth, responsive chat experience. The application is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Laravel Livewire, with Tailwind CSS providing a modern, responsive UI.
